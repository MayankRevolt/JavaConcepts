// Write a Java program to store:

// Your name, age, and whether you’re preparing for SDET.
// Print them in one sentence.

public class A {
    public static void main(String[] a)
    {
        String name= "Mayank";
        int age=31;
        boolean sdet=true;
        
        System.out.println("Hi I am "+name+",aged "+age+" preparing for "+sdet);
        
    }

    
}

Use ternary operator to conditionally print a String if there is a boolean involved 
public class A {
    public static void main(String[] a)
    {
        String name= "Mayank";
        int age=31;
        boolean sdet=true;
        
        String role= sdet ? "SDET":"Some other role";
        
        System.out.println("Hi I am "+name+",aged "+age+" preparing for "+role);
        
    }

    
}


// Explain why String is immutable and how it affects automation frameworks.

Because Strings use thread pool which basically prevents multiple operations to access it & thats why they are immutable (No man can you give me detailed answer for this)
